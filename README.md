# raylib.v
raylib.v is a binding for raylib in V with an aim for 100% parity with the C library.
This isn't a replacement for [vraylib](https://github.com/waotzi/vraylib) just yet, although it aims to go beyond it and provide a more usable library with clearer documentation for both Linux and Windows.
